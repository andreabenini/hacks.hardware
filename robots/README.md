# Omni/Multi purpose
- **GoogleX moonshot robots**  
  Kinda cool stuff here, multipurpose robots, wheeled bots with basic movements and 6 deg freedom arms. A lot of algebra and spacial recognition in human complex environments.
  These bots are aimed toward solving daily tasks: sorting, cleaning, navigating, .... Not an easy task but they're doing real good. Lots of impressive feats
  (some storytelling), inside mechanics, good inner details on basic macro areas from their videos (massive still frames to learn from them).

# Walkers
- **Build your own robotic cat**<br>
  Awesome open source project with reliable body and quite good design, Arduino controlled board could be replaced with a
  pca9685 compatible device and few additional circuits. Body movements are near perfect if you exclude cheap chinese 9g
  plastic servos.<br>
  BTW, impressive feats: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/robotic-cat-petoi-nybble/
- **Quadruped Robot Tsuki**<br>
  Do not follow this bot only. Lingkang Zhang seems to be a really talented guy, his creations are awesome and there's a lot of material, mostly related on quadruped robots but his research papers are useful as a whole. Nice to see him at http://zlethic.com/

# Motors
- **Tips for selecting DC motors for your mobile robot**  
  Self explanatory title showing how to correctly use proper Math in a real scenario. Definitively the best resource
  for it, it takes a while to read and understand the whole article but it's a really good read.
