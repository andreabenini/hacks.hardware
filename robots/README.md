- **Build your own robotic cat**<br>
  Awesome open source project with reliable body and quite good design, Arduino controlled board could be replaced with a
  pca9685 compatible device and few additional circuits. Body movements are near perfect if you exclude cheap chinese 9g
  plastic servos.<br>
  BTW, impressive feats: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/robotic-cat-petoi-nybble/
- **Quadruped Robot Tsuki**<br>
  Do not follow this bot only. Lingkang Zhang seems to be a really talented guy, his creations are awesome and there's a lot of material, mostly related on quadruped robots but his research papers are useful as a whole. Nice to see him at http://zlethic.com/
