# Omni/Multi purpose
- **GoogleX moonshot robots**  
  Kinda cool stuff here, multipurpose robots, wheeled bots with basic movements and 6 deg freedom arms. A lot of algebra and spacial recognition in human complex environments.
  These bots are aimed toward solving daily tasks: sorting, cleaning, navigating, .... Not an easy task but they're doing real good. Lots of impressive feats
  (some storytelling), inside mechanics, good inner details on basic macro areas from their videos (massive still frames to learn from them).

- **Yandex’s delivery robot**  
  The story behind the creation of Yandex’s delivery robots. This is a really nice project
  description, much like some sort of storytelling/blog series. It's not too technical, there are
  no in depth information, there's no code but as a maker I really appreciate the whole
  project description, missed steps, project iterations, trial and error stages and so on.
  The bot idea is heavily borrowed from Amazon Scout, it has the same shape/size/mechanics
  and basic ideas but in a truly Russian style (sturdy frame, minimal components, less flashy
  but reliable).  
  Navigation software from their autonomous cars biggest brothers, I'm really impressed by them:

  storytelling, no tech details but really fun


# Walkers
- **Build your own robotic cat**<br>
  Awesome open source project with reliable body and quite good design, Arduino controlled board could be replaced with a
  pca9685 compatible device and few additional circuits. Body movements are near perfect if you exclude cheap chinese 9g
  plastic servos.<br>
  BTW, impressive feats: https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/robotic-cat-petoi-nybble/
- **Quadruped Robot Tsuki**<br>
  Do not follow this bot only. Lingkang Zhang seems to be a really talented guy, his creations are awesome and there's a lot of material, mostly related on quadruped robots but his research papers are useful as a whole. Nice to see him at http://zlethic.com/


# Rocker Bogie designs
- Stair climbing robot  
  https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5363032  
  DTU Robocup contender, see also Thingiverse Martian Robot design (link in its description) where this one got design ideas
- Rocker Bogie Mechanism  
  https://www.slideshare.net/HaniroothChandraseka/rocker-bogie-mechanism-design-and-fabrication
  Basic explaination but there's an important thing here: all formulas for calculating the length of the links, tilt base, wheels and so on.
- ExoMy: A Low Cost 3D Printed Rover.  
  https://github.com/esa-prl/ExoMy/wiki  
  Kinda ESA version for babies
- DIY Mars Perseverance Rover Replica – Arduino based Project  
  https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/diy-mars-perseverance-rover-replica-with-arduino/  
  Probably one of the best and accurate project I've ever seen. Mechanics part is really well detailed and impressive,
  STL cad files are well engineered and suitable for generic robots too, it's not just for a bare replica but easily
  adaptable to a generic rover bogie robot.
- Sawppy the rover  
  https://newscrewdriver.com/category/projects/sawppy-the-rover/  
  This is good, a lot of variations from original Nasa project, aims to be practical and not just a bare replica
