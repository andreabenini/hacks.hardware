# TableSaw builds
#### W A R N I N G  :
This section is a real mess if you're concerned about safety. Safety is essential but all around the web
(and youtube in particular) seems to be some kind of strange optional.<br>
**Please** seriously consider some kind of tablesaw guards or blade protectors if you want to keep your
fingers (or any part of choice from your body) where they actually are

    A really small one but with nice hints, a good build if you want to save your pocket and lots of space

    One of the best builds around, clever build but excellent quality and execution. Everything is done with few tools
    (drill, router and a lot of manual tools), definitively something to look at if you have a lot of space for it...
