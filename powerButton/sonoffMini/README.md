# powerButton version for Sonoff Mini
This version has been totally rewritten for Sonoff Mini and it has been used for my main desktop PC.
I usually keep everything connected to a master switch to turn on/off the entire equipent at once
(PC, monitors, scanner, printer, speakers). Using a sonoff mini also provides me the capability to
control this set from remote and integrate everything with internal HomeAssistant environment.
