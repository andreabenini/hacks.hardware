- [Parametric Mechanical Keycap Library](https://github.com/rsheldiii/KeyV2)  
    OpenSCAD library for creating custom _.STL_ keycaps, seems to be promising and accurate.
    It still doesn't solve double shot keycaps generation but for a static keycap seems to
    be enough, expecially with ABS materials.
